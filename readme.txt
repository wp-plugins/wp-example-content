== Description ==

Welcome to the WP Example Content! With the options provided, you can add and remove example post content to assist you in designing and developing new and current themes. Enjoy!

After activating the plugin, simply access the plugin in the admin panel navigation (usually the last item).

Choose to "add a bundle of posts and pages", or "remove all posts and pages" added by the plugin.
